# Java Host Research
This repo contains research documents and PoC application showcasing the feasibility of using wasmer-java as a Host Wasm Runtime Environment. The research was conducted in accordance to the W3F foundation [grant](https://github.com/w3f/Grants-Program/pull/1353).

## Research Documents
3 main documents were produced as result of the research:
- [Research Outcome](https://github.com/LimeChain/java-host-research/blob/main/research/java-host-research-outcome.md)
- [Java Light Client Design](https://github.com/LimeChain/java-host-research/blob/main/research/java-host-light-client-high-level-design.md)
- [Polkadot Java Host Design](https://github.com/LimeChain/java-host-research/blob/main/research/java-polkadot-host-high-level-design.md)

Additionally 2 more documents were created:
- [Scope & Estimation for Libp2p JVM Kademlia Implementation](https://github.com/LimeChain/java-host-research/blob/main/research/libp2p-kademlia-for-jvm-scope-estimation.md)
- [Scope & Estimation for Libp2p JVM Yamux Implementation](https://github.com/LimeChain/java-host-research/blob/main/research/libp2p-yamux-jvm-scope-estimation.md)
